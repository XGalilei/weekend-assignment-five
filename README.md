# Project Name

## Description

The following app is a representation of a comment/feedback submission system, based on the daily feedback form Prime Academy uses.

- [X] Each step only allows the user to advance to the next step if a score is provided
- [X] The user must input a score between 1-5
- [X] `Comments` do not need to be validated
- [X] A `Review` step, which will be clicked in order to acutally submit completed feedback to the server
- [X] User will be linked to a new survey page upon completion

There appears to be a problem with the current code in which the servers are not responding properly: this may be an issue related to the different computers (this was coded on a Windows 10 PC rather than on macOS).
